'''
Scenario:
You are building a program for a vending machine that only dispenses snacks under specific conditions. The vending machine has several sensors that monitor various factors before allowing a snack to be dispensed.

The machine will only dispense a snack if:

The item stock is greater than zero.
The machine temperature is within an acceptable range.
Either the user has enough balance to purchase the snack OR the user has entered a valid discount code.
Design a program that determines whether the vending machine should dispense a snack or not, based on these conditions.

Inputs:
The number of items in stock.
The current temperature of the vending machine.
The userâ€™s balance.
Whether or not the user has entered a valid discount code.
Outputs:
If the conditions are met, output: "Snack dispensed!"
If the conditions are not met, output: "Unable to dispense snack."
'''

price_item = int(input("Enter the price of the item:"))

number_items = int(input("Enter the amount of items:"))

temperature = int(input("Enter the current temperature:"))

balance = int(input("Enter the user's balance:"))

is_valid_code = input("Is there a valid discount code? (Yes or No):")

# Checking if correct inputs were put into is_valid_code (yes or no ONLY)

if (is_valid_code.lower() != "yes" and is_valid_code.lower() != "no"):
    print("Invalid input for the valid discount code. Only can put YES or NO!")

# Otherwise if inputs are okay, run the program in the else block
else:

  # Checking for the multiple conditions using connectors of or and
  # A range is also present hence the <= syntax for temperature
  
  if (number_items > 0 and 10 <= temperature <= 35 and balance >= price_item or is_valid_code.lower() == "yes"):
    print("dispense")
  
  # If these conditions are not meant then run the else block
  
  else:
    print("no dispense")
