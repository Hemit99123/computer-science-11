# Importing Notes Rules

# use this syntax so you don't import the whole lib but only the functions that you will be using

from math import pi, e, log, sin, cos

# use "as" which will change the name of the function to something else to make it more descriptive
# for example...

# this changes the function e which is not that descriptive to eular which makes more sense

from math import e as eular
