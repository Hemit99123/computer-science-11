# Algorithms

Algorithms are a step-by-step solution to a problem.

It has 3 parts:

1. **Input**
2. **Computation**
3. **Output**

The computation process takes the input and generates an output.

## Steps for designing an algorithm:

1. **Identify the Output:**

   - Start with the easiest part, which is identifying what the output is asking for.
   - This helps in designing the computation process.

2. **Determine the Inputs:**

   - Identify the inputs based on the problem.
   - If no inputs are specified, the algorithm cannot work as it won't be able to produce an output.

3. **Design the Computation Process:**
   - This is the hardest part.
   - Here, you design a step-by-step process that uses the inputs to produce the desired output.
