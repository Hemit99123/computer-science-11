# Difference between complied and interprative langauges 

### Complied:

Complied languages go through a complier program that creates a machine readable (binary) file which is executable. The code file itself is NOT executable. This means extra memory is required because you have to store this machine readable file which can be costly.

### Interprative:

Interprative language's code files are executable. They will execute each statement line-by-line into binary format for computer to understand. This means more memory because you don't have an extra file to store. But, also more compute time because it takes longer for the computer to convert each statement to binary form.
